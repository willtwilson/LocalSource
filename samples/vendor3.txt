Jersey Herb Garden specializes in growing culinary and medicinal herbs in St. Clement. All our herbs are pesticide-free and hand-harvested to ensure the highest quality. We supply many local restaurants with fresh herbs and also sell directly to customers. Visit our garden on weekends where you can pick your own herbs and attend workshops on herbal remedies and cooking with fresh herbs. Check our website for opening times as they vary seasonally.
