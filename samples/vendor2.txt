Green Valley Farm is a family-run operation in St. Ouen focusing on sustainable farming practices. We offer a variety of seasonal fruits including strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries in summer, and apples and pears in autumn. Our produce is available at our farm shop which is open daily from 10am to 6pm. We also sell homemade jams and preserves made from our fruits.
