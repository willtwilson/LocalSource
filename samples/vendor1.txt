Amy's Fresh Produce has been a staple at the local markets for over 15 years. We grow all our vegetables using organic methods without chemical pesticides. Specializing in seasonal root vegetables and leafy greens, we harvest everything the morning of sale to ensure maximum freshness. Our farm is located in the scenic parish of St. Mary, where the rich soil produces exceptionally flavorful produce. Come visit us at our roadside stand every Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3pm!
