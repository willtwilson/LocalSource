Review what the current / next task is and then build that out. 
Think carefully in order to get things right the first time.
Remember that this should be a Docker hosted web-app so try not to install or run things directly on the host, use Docker as much as possible; also installed on the host are Tailscale for networking and Playwright for browser testing.

If you get to the end of a task or subtask, run any prescribed 'tests' and document the result in 'test_status.md'. Do not move on to the next step unless the current task has 'passed' without any fails the current test or 'postponed' the test. Where possible, run any postponed tests.

Then move on to the next task and update the status accordingly.
Repeat this process until no more tasks left.

If you get stuck, proceed with your best approach. 
Make all changes yourself directly. Do not require my input.
Use verbose commands/queries in order to make debugging better.
